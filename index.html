            <h2>A Poem for You</h2>
            <h3>A Love Letter in Lines and Light</h3>
            <p> In the strokes of a pen, I’ve tried to show,
                A heart that’s yours, more than you know.
                Each line, each swirl, is a piece of me,
                Bound to the beauty in you I see.
                
                Your name etched in a timeless art,
                A symbol of the rhythm that guides my heart.
                The stars in your eyes outshine the night,
                And your smile, oh, it’s my guiding light.
                
                A simple "N," yet it holds my world,
                Where love and dreams are gently swirled.
                This gift, a canvas, a token, a sign,
                Of a love so pure, it’s simply divine.
                
                You are the sunset’s gentle hue,
                The softest shade of every view.
                And as I walk this maze called life,
                Your warmth cuts through every strife.
                
                This Valentine, I give you my heart,
                In every drawing, every written part.
                For words and art are all I can give,
                To show the joy in the life I live.</p>
                <section id="closing">
                    <h2>Thank You</h2>
                    <p>Words can't fully express how much I appreciate you and how grateful I am to have you in my life. You are kind, smart, beautiful, and an all-around an amazing person. I love you, and no one has my heart like you do, no one is on my mind like you are. I can’t find the right words to capture just how much you mean to me.</p>
